After months and months of procrastinating it looks like I've finally decided to read the Next.js docs to figure out what a dynamic route is.
And with this new-found knowledge finally added a blog section to my personal site. big!

The writing and design definitely needs some work... but thats for some other time.

I don't necessarily have any plans for this, just perhaps some occasional updates for projects or any particular topic that interests me.  
The creation of this website of mine may be a good topic to touch on. 

It is pretty amazing going from googling 'postgresql vs sql differences' reading articles written by AI from clickfarm IT websites to finally getting a working, responsive, website deployed to the internet.
